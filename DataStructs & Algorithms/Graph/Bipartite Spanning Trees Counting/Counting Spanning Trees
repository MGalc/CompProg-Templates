There's a simple equation to count the amount of spanning trees there are within a bipartite graph.
L = Number of elements on the left side of the bipartite graph
R = Number of elements on the right side of the bipartite graph
# of spanning trees = L^(R-1) * R^(L-1)

This will generally need to be implemented within Java's BigInteger as the values get large quite quickly.
