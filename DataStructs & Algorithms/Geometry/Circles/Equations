A circle is given by:
    r^2 = x^2 + y^2
    r^2 = (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
        Where
        a, b are the center of the circle
        r is the radius

An eclipse is given by:
    (x^2 / n^2) + (y^2 / m^2) = 1
If not centered at the origin:
    ((x-a)^2 / n^2) + ((y-b)^2 / m^2) = 1
        Where
        a, b are the center of the ellipse
        n is the radius along the x-axis
        m is the radius along the y-axis

PI 
    = acos(-1.0) or acos(0.0) * 2

Ellipse area
    = PI * A * B
        Where 
        A = x-axis radius
        Y = y-axis radius

Circle area 
    = PI * r^2

Circle circumference 
    = PI * diameter = 2 * PI * r

Arc length 
    = circumference * (angle / 360)

Chord length 
    = sqrt(2 * r^2 * (1 - cos(angle)))
    = 2 * r * sin(angle / 2)

Sector area
    = circleArea * (angle / 360)

Segment (Between chord and arc)
    = sectorArea - triangleArea(r, r, chordLength)

Convert to Radians from Degrees
    Radians = Degrees * (PI / 180.0)

Convert to Degrees from Radians
    Degrees = Radians * (180.0 / PI)
